# Penguin Species Clustering Project

## Overview

This project aims to support a team of researchers studying penguins in Antarctica by applying data science techniques to classify penguins into groups based on the available physical characteristics. The researchers have provided a dataset containing **culmen length**, **culmen depth**, **flipper length**, **body mass**, and **sex** of penguins but do not know the species. The task is to perform clustering analysis to identify groups within the dataset, potentially corresponding to the three native penguin species: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**.

### Dataset

The dataset provided (`penguins.csv`) contains the following columns:

- **culmen_length_mm**: Length of the penguin’s bill (mm)
- **culmen_depth_mm**: Depth of the penguin’s bill (mm)
- **flipper_length_mm**: Length of the penguin’s flippers (mm)
- **body_mass_g**: Mass of the penguin (g)
- **sex**: Penguin's sex (Male/Female)

### Objective

- **Perform exploratory data analysis** to understand the distributions and relationships between the variables.
- **Apply clustering algorithms** to identify potential species groups in the data.
- **Interpret the clusters** and make suggestions about which clusters correspond to which penguin species.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/penguin-clustering.git
cd penguin-clustering
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:

### Step 3: Run the Analysis

To preprocess the data, perform clustering, and visualize the results, run the following scripts:

1. **Preprocess the Data**:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python src/exploratory_analysis.py
   ```

3. **Run Clustering Models**:
   ```bash
   python src/clustering_model.py
   ```

4. **Visualize the Results**:
   ```bash
   python src/cluster_visualization.py
   ```

## Methods and Algorithms

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Handling missing values**: Ensuring that all data points are valid.
- **Scaling**: Features such as culmen length, flipper length, and body mass will be standardized to have comparable ranges.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualizing the distributions of each feature and relationships between features to detect any patterns or anomalies.

### 3. **Clustering**

Several clustering algorithms may be applied to identify species groups:
- **K-Means**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into `k` clusters.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method that builds a tree-like structure to represent nested clusters.
- **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes.

### 4. **Cluster Interpretation**

- Once the clusters are formed, we will interpret the groups by analyzing their feature statistics.
- Attempt to map the clusters to the known penguin species in the region (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo).

## Results

The results include the formation of distinct clusters that likely represent different penguin species. These clusters will be evaluated based on the separation of key features (culmen, flipper, and body mass), and a visualization will be generated to display the findings.

### Future Improvements

- **Incorporate Additional Features**: If more data becomes available, incorporating additional features (e.g., habitat location) could improve classification.
- **Supervised Learning**: Once labeled data is available, consider training a supervised machine learning model to predict species.
